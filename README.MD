Hello, my name is Eduard Itrich! I'm an open-source and infrastructure evangelist 
currently empowering the [Sovereign Cloud Stack](https://scs.community) community at the [OSB Alliance 
(Open Source Business Alliance)](https://osb-alliance.com). After graduating from university,
I was part of a software development team and responsible for the release management of a
Linux enterprise distribution. Following up my two-year parental leave, during which 
I orchestrated my twin daughters rather than continuous deployment pipelines, I became 
the head of digitalization and IT of a medium-sized town in southwestern Germany.
In my spare time, I hang around at [Section77 e.V](https://section77.de/). â€” a local Hackspace in Offenburg.
Follow me for varied content on eGovernment, Civic Tech, Smart City, Open Source,
and Open Infrastructure.
